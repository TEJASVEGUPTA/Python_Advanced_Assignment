    "**Ans:** The differences between Text Files and Binary Files are:\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Binary files** are those typical files that store data in the form of sequence of bytes grouped into eight bits or sometimes sixteen bits. These bits represent custom data and such files can store multiple types of data (images, audio, text, etc) under a single file."
